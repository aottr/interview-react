Start by selecting the starter template you want to use:

- [React + TypeScript + Vite](react-vanilla)

## What is the app about?
We want to have a simple blog app that allows to list and read blog posts.

## API to use
- [JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
- [Rest API Documentation](https://docs.mockend.com/rest)

## Tasks
1. Retrieve 20 blog posts from the [JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API.
2. Display each post in a list of [Cards](https://daisyui.com/components/card/) with the following properties:
    - Title
    - Body (truncated to 50 characters)
3. Add a link to each post (Button in Action Row) that allows to read the post `/post/:id`.
4. Add a page to display the blog post `/post/:id` with the following properties:
    - Title
    - Body
